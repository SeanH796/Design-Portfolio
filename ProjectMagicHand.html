<p>At Magic Hand, We belive the world and the future is holded in your hand. To achieve that
goal, we use hand motions and muscle expentions to accurately sense your hand posistions and
control your virtual world. The light weight hand set comes with customizeable finger ring sensors
to detect small movements with your fingers, using the adjustable wrist bands as the motion sensor
and as a battery pack to connect ear pieces and head sets. Compare to other VR/AR hand set,
the light weight and minimalistic design let users have the device as part of their body in the virtual
world. By using a combination of soft fabrics and matt textured rubber, the product is durable
and sweat proof, but also gentle enough for human hands to avoid any potential health hazzard.
The product is wiedly compatible with wide range of platform and devices, and there will be
more support and application access will be aveliable in the future.</p>
